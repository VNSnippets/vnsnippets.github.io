The .NET User Group (Mauritius) recently hosted an engaging meetup focused on .NET 9 and how .NET has been evolving in general. With about 35 attendees from different professional backgrounds and affiliations, the event took place at SD Worx Mauritius.

### Evolutions of .NET for an Architect
To kickoff the first session, I presented a little overview of .NET 9 and what is coming next without diving into too much details. Instead I zoned in on how should Senior/Lead Developers and Architects use such information in their day to day work, focusing on:
- Understanding the .NET iterations (standard and long term support)
- Staying up-to-date on the changes happening during preview modes
- Interpreting that information to extract actionable tasks for your company
- Planning and executing such a migration of technology

It was a bit different from my usual coding sessions since this requiring a lot more of introspection and open-mindedness from the audience. After all, everyone wants to jump to the latest tech - but asking yourself if you need to can be akin to an existential crisis!

### .NET 9 and What's in it?
Yash B. and Samanta L. presented next on .NET 9 and the new features being added to it. They made sure to include some code snippets to concretize their explanations and did a broad sweep of everything new.

If I am being honest, I did not know about everything they presented! So even though I myself am staying in touch with the progress of .NET, I learned quite a bit from their presentation. They covered:
- The cloud-native focus of .NET 9 and how new features are being added to help
- The performance boosts and optimizations at different levels including in C# itself
- Library enhancements that are already here, and soon to come
- Further enhancements to allow easier and better integration of AI with .NET

### And it's a burrito (wrap)!
All in all, it was a wonderful event organized in record time (less than a week of public announcement!) with a great audience and amazing speakers.

The willingness of SD Worx Mauritius to quickly accommodate for the needs of this event - even going so far as to organize food catering and goodies - was greatly appreciated. The staff also remained present till the end of the event in the evening and made sure to help entertain the guests and keep a lively atmosphere.

Till the next one, stay techy :)
